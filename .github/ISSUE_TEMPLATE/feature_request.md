If requesting a feature, please add links to the [Firebase API or SDK document pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference) that describe the feature you want.  If one of the SDKs does not have the feature you are looking for, odds are it will not be invented for this "Godot SDK."

If you don't know which SDK to start digging through for your feature, it may help to know that this project runs on the [Firebase REST API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest) and is based heavily on the [JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/v8), with bits from the [Java](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/java/reference/com/google/firebase/package-summary) and [Unity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/unity) SDKs.
